# magic-api

Don't spend time building your API, just define them and let it happen magically.

## TODO:
- Custom Middleware
- Only support POST
- Support using paths rather than encoding everything to a monolithic API.
- Support automatically wrapping non-promise functions with promises.
- Test error cases.
- Allow extensive configuration.
    - Frontend middleware, custom fetch functions, etc.
